Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

This project was created using the dataset from kaggle Link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection?select=fraudTrain.csv

The primary purpose of the project was to come up with a model to detect credit card fraud

It also involved pre-processing the data and exploratory data analysis steps before the data was ready for modeling

Various Supervised Learning models were considered and an attempt was made to combine supervised and unsupervised learning together. 
Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes with min-max scaling stood out as the optimal choice. 
The F-1 score proved to be a more effective performance measure, accounting for both false negatives and false positives in this context.
